# High-Level Code Audit: src/

## Overview
This audit reviews the `src` directory for code structure, naming, abstractions, readability, testability, separation of concerns, and complexity. No code changes were made. No files in any `@legacy` folder were reviewed.

---

## Folder/Module Reviews

### 1. components/
- **Structure:** Follows atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates). Each layer is well-separated and has index files for easier imports.
- **Naming:** Consistent and descriptive. Atoms/molecules/organisms/templates are named for their UI role.
- **Abstractions:** Atoms are simple, reusable; molecules/organisms compose lower layers. No overengineering observed. Molecules and organisms are thin wrappers, but could be extended for more complex forms.
- **Readability:** Good use of TypeScript types. File names match component names. Code is concise and idiomatic.
- **Testability:** Each atom has a `.test.tsx` file, and Storybook stories exist for visual/interaction testing. Molecules and organisms lack direct tests.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Layers are respected; no cross-imports from higher to lower layers.
- **Complexity:** No obvious hotspots; components are presentational and stateless where appropriate.
- **Issues:**
  - Test files may lack coverage for edge cases and accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes).
  - Molecules/organisms/templates lack direct unit/integration tests.
  - No clear documentation per layer.

### 2. hooks/
- **Structure:** Contains custom hooks (`useAuth.tsx`, `useDebounce.hook.ts`).
- **Naming:** Clear and idiomatic.
- **Abstractions:** Hooks are separated from components, as expected. `useAuth` provides context and guards, `useDebounce` is a pure utility.
- **Readability:** File names match hook names; code is idiomatic and easy to follow.
- **Testability:** No test files observed for hooks.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Hooks are not mixed with UI code.
- **Complexity:** No evidence of unnecessary complexity, but `useAuth` could be tested for context edge cases.
- **Issues:**
  - Missing unit tests for hooks.
  - No documentation on hook usage or expected return values.

### 3. pages/
- **Structure:** Each page is a separate file (e.g., `login.page.tsx`).
- **Naming:** Consistent and descriptive.
- **Abstractions:** Pages are thin wrappers, likely composing templates/organisms.
- **Readability:** File names are clear; code is simple and maintainable.
- **Testability:** No test files observed for pages.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Pages are separated from routing and components.
- **Complexity:** No obvious issues, but large page files can become hard to maintain as features grow.
- **Issues:**
  - No tests for page-level logic or integration.
  - Potential for large, monolithic page components as app grows.

### 4. routes/
- **Structure:** Contains route guards/components (`private.route.tsx`, etc.).
- **Naming:** Clear and descriptive.
- **Abstractions:** Route logic is separated from pages/components. Guards are implemented as components.
- **Readability:** File names are clear; code is concise and idiomatic.
- **Testability:** No test files observed for routes.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Routing logic is isolated.
- **Complexity:** No obvious issues, but guard logic should be reviewed for edge cases (e.g., role checks, redirects).
- **Issues:**
  - No tests for route guards or protected routes.
  - No documentation on route guard behavior.

### 5. utils/
- **Structure:** Currently empty.
- **Naming:** N/A
- **Abstractions:** N/A
- **Readability:** N/A
- **Testability:** N/A
- **Separation of Concerns:** N/A
- **Complexity:** N/A
- **Issues:**
  - No shared utilities present; if added, ensure they are pure and well-tested.

### 6. assets/
- **Structure:** Contains static assets (e.g., `react.svg`).
- **Naming:** Clear.
- **Abstractions:** N/A
- **Readability:** N/A
- **Testability:** N/A
- **Separation of Concerns:** N/A
- **Complexity:** N/A
- **Issues:** None.

### 7. Root Files (App.tsx, main.tsx, etc.)
- **Structure:** Standard React entry points. `App.tsx` composes routes and providers cleanly.
- **Naming:** Conventional.
- **Abstractions:** N/A
- **Readability:** N/A
- **Testability:** No test files for entry points.
- **Separation of Concerns:** N/A
- **Complexity:** N/A
- **Issues:**
  - No tests for root rendering or error boundaries.

---

## Complexity Hotspots
- No evidence of O(n^2) or higher complexity in presentational code.
- If utils are added, review for nested iteration or inefficient algorithms.
- `useDebounce` is O(1) per update; no time/space issues.

---

## Overengineering / Unnecessary Abstractions
- No evidence of overengineering. Abstractions are appropriate for atomic design and React best practices.

---

## Misnamed Files/Classes/Functions
- No misnamed files detected. Naming is clear and consistent.

---

## Test Gaps & Coverage Issues
- Atoms have test files, but coverage depth is unclear (edge cases, a11y, etc.).
- No tests for hooks, pages, routes, or root files.
- No integration or E2E test coverage observed in `src`.

---

## Suggestions for Structure Improvement
- Add/expand documentation per atomic layer and for custom hooks.
- Add/expand unit and integration tests for hooks, pages, and routes.
- Add E2E tests for critical user flows.
- If utils are added, ensure they are pure, well-named, and tested.

---

## Suggested Tests for Improved Coverage

### 1. Atoms
- **Button**: Test all props (label, children, loading, disabled, type, className, onClick). Check ARIA attributes and keyboard accessibility.
- **Input**: Test value, onChange, placeholder, disabled, readOnly, type, className, and ARIA attributes.
- **Label**: Test htmlFor, children, className, and ARIA attributes.

### 2. Molecules
- **FormGroup**: Test rendering with different label/value/onChange, ensure Input and Label are correctly linked, and test accessibility.

### 3. Organisms/Templates
- **AuthForm**: Test form state, input changes, and submission (if applicable). Mock context if needed.
- **AuthTemplate**: Test layout and that AuthForm is rendered.

### 4. Hooks
- **useAuth**: Test login/logout, context value, and error when used outside provider.
- **useDebounce**: Test value updates after delay, and that cleanup works on unmount or value change.

### 5. Pages
- Test that each page renders expected content and handles navigation/redirects as intended.

### 6. Routes
- **PrivateRoute/ProtectedRoute/PublicRoute**: Test access control logic, redirects for unauthenticated/unauthorized users, and correct rendering for allowed users.

### 7. Integration/E2E
- Simulate full user flows: login, protected page access, logout, and error cases. Use Cypress or Playwright.

### 8. Accessibility
- Use axe or Storybook a11y addon to check for violations in all components and pages.

---

*Add these tests incrementally, prioritizing core flows and critical components first.*

---

## Final Scores
- **Code Quality:** 8/10
- **Architecture:** 8/10
- **Readability:** 8/10
- **Maintainability:** 7/10

---

## Next Step Recommendations
1. Add/expand unit tests for hooks, pages, and routes (high priority).
2. Add/expand documentation for atomic layers and custom hooks (medium priority).
3. Add E2E/integration tests for user flows (medium priority).
4. Review and test any new utils for complexity and purity (ongoing).
